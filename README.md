# Human_Religion_and_Consciousness_Mapping_Project

This project aims to analyze historical texts spanning from 9600 BC to 2000 AD to identify key themes related to human consciousness, religion, events, and other significant categories. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the project categorizes text into predefined themes, performs sentiment analysis, and visualizes the frequency of these themes over time.
